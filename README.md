## Safe-Exchange 
Trustless Exchanges made secure. 

[This project and presentation won the top Identity project prize at the Denver, Colorado Hackathon held August 18-19, 2017]

Safe Exchange brings trust to what might have traditionally been a trustless exchange. It also adds the ability to sell and buy with reward points.

Imagine a large transaction, such as a five figure used car sale. Buyers now have the ability to verify that the full name of the seller matches the title. Buyers also can now use our Credit API tool to help earn rewards points faster.

## API's Used 
* Identity
* Rewards
* Credit Rewards
* Bank Account Starter

## Team Members
* Mark Scheel
* Mike Lockwitz
* Kenny Partin
